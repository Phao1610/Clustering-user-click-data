# Linear-Regression-with-Streamlit
- Seam Carving is a new way to crop images without losing important content in the image. This is often referred to as "content-aware" cropping or image retargeting. 
- During this period, the group performed the following tasks: 
    First create a new image (mask) by clipping a bouding box in the selected image. 
    
    Then save the position of the mask in the original image to the list (lst_roi).
