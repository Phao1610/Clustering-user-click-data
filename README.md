# Linear-Regression-with-Streamlit
- Linear regression 

    Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.

    This form of analysis estimates the coefficients of the linear equation, involving one or more independent variables that best predict the value of the dependent variable. Linear regression fits a straight line or surface that minimizes the discrepancies between predicted and actual output values. There are simple linear regression calculators that use a “least squares” method to discover the best-fit line for a set of paired data. You then estimate the value of X (dependent variable) from Y (independent variable).

- Streamlit Python

    Streamlit is an open-source (free) Python library, which provides a fast way to build interactive web apps. It is a relatively new package launched in 2019 but has been growing tremendously. It is designed and built especially for machine learning engineers or other data science professionals. Once you are done with your analysis in Python, you can quickly turn those scripts into web apps/tools to share with others.

    As long as you can code in Python, it should be straightforward for you to write Streamlit apps. Imagine the app as the canvas. We can write Python scripts from top to bottom to add all kinds of elements, including text, charts, widgets, tables, etc.

    In this tutorial, we’ll build an example app with Streamlit in Python. You’ll be able to use the common elements and commands from Streamlit and expand to others on your own!
